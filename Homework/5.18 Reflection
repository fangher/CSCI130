Reflection

Prior to taking this course, I had no experience whatsoever regarding web programming and the designs to developing a web site. 
This is probably one of the most unique classes I have taken in college. It was different to the classes I have been in, 
and at the same time, it was also quite refreshing. It was a learning experience considering how the class pretty much went 
at its own pace. Overall, the class was pretty enjoyable.
